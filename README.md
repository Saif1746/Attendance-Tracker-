# Attendance-Tracker-

Basic Attendance Tracker in python

A simple Python-based attendance tracking program that allows you to add and view attendance records for students across different subjects. This project is helpful for basic record-keeping and can be easily extended for more functionalities.

## Features

 ### 1. Add Attendance: 
Add attendance records for students, including their names, subjects, and dates.

 ### 2. View Attendance:

   Summary: See a count of attendance records per student and subject.

   Detail: View the entire list of attendance entries.

### How to Use

1. Run the Program: Start the script to access the main menu.

2. Choose an Action:

Type 1 to add a new attendance record.

Type 2 to view attendance (summary or detailed).

### Add Attendance:

Enter the student's name, subject (Eng, Math, Chem), and date (dd/mm/yy format).

### View Attendance:

Choose "summary" to view a summarized count of attendance by student and subject.

Choose "detail" to view each attendance entry in full.

### Program Walkthrough

The get_input() function is the main menu where users choose to either add or view attendance.

The add() function prompts for the studentâ€™s name, subject, and date, then writes this data to attendance.txt.

The view() function allows users to view either a summary or a detailed record:

summary: Displays the number of attendance entries per student for each subject.

detail: Lists each attendance entry line-by-line.

### Code Details

File Management: Attendance records are stored in attendance.txt, allowing easy file reading and appending.

Dictionary Usage: For the summary view, a dictionary (dic) is used to count attendance entries for each student-subject pair.

Example:

Adding Attendance:

Enter the name of the student: Alice
Enter the subject for which the attendance is to be added [Eng, Math, Chem]: eng
Enter the date in dd/mm/yy format: 01/11/24

Viewing Attendance Summary:

Alice appears 3 time(s) for the subject Eng
Bob appears 2 time(s) for the subject Math
